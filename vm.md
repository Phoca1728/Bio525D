Working with the Virtual Machine (VM)
=====================================

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) on your laptop or server. Be sure to select the appropriate installer for your OS and just follow the instructions. This should go smoothly but we will help with any issues that arise.

2. Under the `File` menu, select *Import Appliance* and choose the VM file from your local machine.

3. After about 15 minutes the machine will login to the Fedora desktop (the Operating System we are using). The username is "Darwin" and this is the only choice. Select "Darwin" and enter: `ubcbio525` as the password.

**SPECIAL NOTES** 

- There are some resource requirements for running the VM as it is currently set up (~20 Gb hard drive and >2Gb RAM). If this is an issue, we will reconfigure things so that everyone has a chance to try the exercises.

- Also, please be patient. The VM will likely be a little slower and feel less responsive compared to your host machine. If the machine goes to sleep, swipe up on the lock screen and log back in. 

##DESKTOP NAVIATION##

- The VM with automatically capture your mouse and keyboard, so read the messages about how to switch between the host and VM. You can disable host integration at anytime, and this may make it easy to navigate around the VM desktop.

- With the cursor select "Activities" from the top left and then choose whatever application is need. For example, Terminal or RStudio. These will be the two primary applications that will be used.
