##RESOURCES##

- See the [syllabus](https://github.com/UBCBio525/Bio525D/blob/master/syllabus.md) for an overview of the course.

- The [Virtual Machine guide](https://github.com/UBCBio525/Bio525D/blob/master/vm.md) has instructions for working with VirtualBox and the Virtual Machine that will be used for all practical sessions.

- For those wanting to work on their own machine, the [programs](https://github.com/UBCBio525/Bio525D/blob/master/programs.md) file has a listing of the software used for each exercise.

- The slides, commands, or any other information for each day is under a directory for that day. For example, the directory [01](https://github.com/UBCBio525/Bio525D/tree/master/01) contains information for day 1, the directory [02](https://github.com/UBCBio525/Bio525D/tree/master/02) contains information for day 2, and so on.

##NAVIGATING THE SITE##

- To access a file or directory, click that file or directory on the far left, directly over the name of the resource. If you click the message in the middle of the page, that shows what was changed in the commit, which is not what you want to look at.
